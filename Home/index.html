            Welcome to Bimey's-Bit-Games! Here you can find some really cool games I've made. These games are made with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python. For the python games I've used the Turtle and Pygame librarys.

            The minigames section has some basic games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock-Paper-Scissors. The programs section is just some cool programs that I've made. The best games section has my best games. The ones there are mostly made with Python. The other games section has games that don't fit into any other catagories.

            Albert Einstein once said "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." He also said "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." He also said "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." He also said "The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once." The point is that he said a lot of weird stuff that we should all learn from.
